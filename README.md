# O2---A-Semantic-Search-Engine
O2 leverages Google’s search capabilities to implement a semantic search. The core idea in o2 is to allow a user to find documents based on the Intent within the document. For example a user may want to search for an advanced or a basic document on Java programming. The idea of “advanced” or “basic” is represented as an intent graph. A set of terms that if present in the document, reinforces the fact that the document is indeed “basic” or “advanced” in nature. In addition to intents, o2 uses a vocabulary of terms around which these indexes are to be built. For example, o2 can work with the complete set of topics, a student learns in Java and then act as a semantic search engine for these topics.
